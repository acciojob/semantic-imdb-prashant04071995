<summary>
In 1250 B.C, King Agamemnon unites the Greek kingdoms. Achilles fights for Agamemnon but despises his arrogance. Prince Hector of Troy and his brother Paris negotiate a peace treaty with Menelaus, King of Sparta. Paris begins an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen Helen, and he smuggles her aboard his home-bound vessel. Menelaus meets Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy would give him control of the Aegean Sea. Agamemnon gets Odysseus, King of Ithaca, to persuade Achilles to join them.

 Quote: The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now.
